# Taylor Burandt: Advanced GIS Portfolio
[Link to Portfolio](https://tburandt01.github.io/AdvancedGIS/)

# **About Me**
Hello, everyone! My name is Taylor (she/her/hers) and I am a second year MSPPM student at CMU. I am originally from Minnesota and have not lived out of the state until I started this program. While in MN, I worked in local government in a few different roles. Seeing the importance of the public sector but also looking for a change and an update on my quantitative skills, I chose to come to CMU. I am most interested in transportation policy and have spent most of my time at CMU focusing on transportation-related projects when I can. My time at CMU has prepared me for my future career; I interned at a public sector consulting firm in New York City over the summer, and will be returing after graduation. 

# **What I Hope to Learn**
I hope to continue to expand my knowledge of ArcGIS Pro while I have access to it. Additionally, I am looking forward to becoming more familiar with other tools if/when ArcGIS is not available in future professional settings. I am hoping to dive deeper into the relationship of geospatial data and the process of visualization such; especially effectively visualizing for a variety of audiences.
