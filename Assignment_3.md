My map can be seen here. To echo everyone else, I also struggled with the data joining for the county-level data so this map shows only the death rate per each state. 

Overall, I think Mapbox is a great free resource that is capable of producing some professional-looking maps. However, I initially found it difficult to navigate in regard to getting the map started. The process of importing data and then going to the styler was confusing, and the navigation of Mapbox as a whole still does not make a lot of sense to me. Additionally, once in the map and getting the data in, it was overwhelming seeing all of the customizable pieces that came with the basemap/other preloaded features. This is also a positive attribute of the tool in that they can be customized, but it was a lot to process on a first exposure.

It also did not make sense to me what sort of capabilities Mapbox had if data cleaning/joins/formatting needed to be done outside of the tool. To me, a join is a very common practice in most geospatial analysis and doing this type of join outside of a geospatial analysis tool may introduce some human-error that the tool may have caught.

Overall, I think Mapbox could be great with more clear examples and time to work with it. This example felt confusing and was exposure to only a small set of the tools. I think I may enjoy the tool more by dedicating more time to it. Lastly, I was also using a windows machine so Tippecanoe did not work.
