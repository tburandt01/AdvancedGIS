# **ESRI Dashboard**
The creation of the dashboard and all of the associated output was a team effort. The purpose of the dashboard was to show existing and planned bike infrastructure in relation to where HealthyRide stations and locations of interest that are accessible via biking are located in Pittsburgh, PA. This was not the original intent of the dashboard, and the process of getting to the dashboard was documented in an ESRI storyboard. [The full process can be found here.](https://arcg.is/1jmu8X) 

[The final dashboard can be found here.](https://arcg.is/0nXH59)
